### What we do

For most of the 20th century, much of the genome was thought to transcribe RNA that served 
no purpose. Because these transcripts didn't encode proteins, they were hypothesized to
be artifacts of nonfunctioning genes or accidental byproducts of the genome's organization
and transcription machinery. Recent investigations have shown that many of these
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) actually serve a variety of roles in the cell, in particular as
transcription regulators. The largely unexplored *transcriptome* and its non-coding functions
are important for developing a better picture of the intricate mechanisms at play in
transcription, and for how RNA may behave in other contexts, e.g. viruses. By deducing the
functions and interactions of these ncRNAs, we may help inform therapies that seek to counter 
genetic illness or viral infection.

The Lee lab attempts to characterize and elucidate the behavior of ncRNAs. We study this 
primarily through Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), an oncogenic gamma-herpesvirus found in over 90% 
of the human population, and influenza virus, a segmented negative-sense single-stranded 
RNA virus that needs no introduction.

In EBV, we study the role of the ncRNAs EBER1 and EBER2 that are produced in large quantities 
by the virus in its latent stage, both of whose functions are poorly understood. While our
investigations into EBER1 are ongoing, we have shown that EBER2 recruits the PAX5 transcription 
factor to the viral genome in a novel way, implicating it as a guide in activating viral genes.
Since viruses often adopt existing mechanisms from their hosts, we may find that cellular ncRNAs 
exist which use this same peculiar mechanism to enchance or repress transcription.

Our study of influenza virus is more focused on the structure and interactions of the RNA segments 
that compose the viral genome. We predominantly study how segment-segment interactions and 
structure-specific recruitment of nucleoproteins (NP) encoded by the virus impact influenza's ability 
to package itself into new virions and escape the cell. If we can understand the role of these
interactions, we may be able to target them as a means of disrupting viral replication and infectivity.
