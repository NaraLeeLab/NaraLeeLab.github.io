excerpt: "The lab of Dr. Nara Lee focues on non-coding RNA behavior in influenza and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). For influenza, our focus is on nucleoprotein binding to influenza segments and intrasegmental interactions. In EBV, we've been interested in the functions of EBER1 and EBER2, non-coding RNAs produced by the virus."

Dr. Lee currently works at the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
